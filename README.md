**Project Sentinel is an AI-driven, kernel-level security platform for the cloud-native era. It moves beyond reactive, rule-based systems to create a proactive, self-healing security posture, capable of detecting and mitigating zero-day threats in real-time.**

Traditional security tools rely on known signatures, leaving them blind to novel, zero-day attacks. Sentinel takes a fundamentally different approach. By using **eBPF**, it creates a frictionless, high-performance telemetry stream of all syscall and network activity directly from the Linux kernel. This data feeds a state-of-the-art **transformer-based neural network** that learns the "grammar" of normal system behavior. It doesn't hunt for signatures; it detects any deviation from an established, healthy baseline‚Äîthe behavioral fingerprint of an exploit.

When a high-confidence anomaly is detected, Sentinel's **autonomous response engine** programmatically generates and deploys a mitigating eBPF rule across the fleet in **under 100 milliseconds**. It surgically neutralizes the threat at its source without human intervention or service disruption.

This project represents a new paradigm in cloud security: a truly autonomous, self-healing system built for the scale and complexity of the AI era.

## ‚ú® Vision & Core Principles

> Our vision is to create a fully autonomous security fabric that acts as an immune system for the cloud, continuously learning, adapting, and defending against an evolving threat landscape.

* **Proactive, Not Reactive:** We don't chase signatures. We model legitimate behavior to instantly identify any deviation, catching threats the world has never seen before.
* **Autonomous & Self-Healing:** Human intervention is a bottleneck. Sentinel is designed for closed-loop detection and response, reducing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for novel threats from hours to milliseconds.
* **Kernel-Native & Frictionless:** By using eBPF, Sentinel operates directly within the Linux kernel, providing deep visibility without requiring invasive agents, sidecars, or application code modification.
* **AI-Driven Intelligence:** Sentinel's brain is a state-of-the-art AI model that understands the deep, contextual relationships in system activity, moving far beyond simple statistical anomaly detection.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Sentinel platform is composed of four primary planes: Data, Control, Response, and Observability, working in a closed loop to provide autonomous security.

The foundational work for Project Sentinel is complete. The development environment, including a multi-node Kubernetes cluster and the entire data stack, can be bootstrapped with a single command.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/project-sentinel.git](https://github.com/your-username/project-sentinel.git)
cd project-sentinel

# Start the entire local development environment
./bootstrap.sh
```
